SUMMARY = "wolfBoot secure bootloader"
DESCRIPTION = "wolfBoot is a portable, OS-agnostic secure bootloader for \
32-bit and 64-bit targets. It provides verified secure boot with A/B \
update / rollback support. On AMD/Xilinx ZynqMP it replaces U-Boot as \
the second-stage bootloader (FSBL -> PMU FW -> ATF (EL3) -> wolfBoot \
(EL2) -> signed Linux kernel)."

# Keep this recipe out of 'bitbake world' for the same reason as
# wolfboot-signed-image.bb: do_compile requires a signing key pair that the
# user supplies out-of-band, so an unattended world build can only ever fail
# here. Build it explicitly, or pull it in from an image recipe.

# Linux rootfs device passed via the DTB /chosen/bootargs root= patch in

# REQUIRED: absolute path to a pre-generated wolfBoot signing private key
# (DER format, RSA4096 by default). Generate once via
# `wolfboot-keygen --rsa4096 -g wolfboot_signing_private_key.der` and store
# outside the build tree (never inside DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE or sstate).
# See README.md for the full provisioning workflow.
WOLFBOOT_SIGNING_KEY ?= ""

# OPTIONAL: absolute path to a pre-generated wolfBoot signing public key
# (DER format). If unset, wolfBoot's keygen derives the public key from the
# private key in-memory to populate src/keystore.c. Only set this if you
# want to pin a public key independent of the private key file (e.g. HSM).
WOLFBOOT_PUBLIC_KEY ?= ""

# public half from a supplied private key) and wolfboot-sign (used by
# wolfboot-signed-image.bb for FIT image signing).

# Additional flags passed to 'make wolfboot.elf'. These are command-line
# overrides, so they take precedence over .config assignments. WARNING:
# do NOT use this for CFLAGS_EXTRA — command-line CFLAGS_EXTRA+= would
# replace ALL file-level CFLAGS_EXTRA lines, wiping out critical defines
# like SDHCI_FORCE_CARD_DETECT. Use WOLFBOOT_EXTRA_CONFIG_LINES instead.
WOLFBOOT_EXTRA_MAKE_FLAGS ?= ""

# Extra lines appended to the .config after the template is copied.
# Use this for CFLAGS_EXTRA additions (e.g. "CFLAGS_EXTRA+=-O2") so they
# coexist with the template's own CFLAGS_EXTRA lines.
