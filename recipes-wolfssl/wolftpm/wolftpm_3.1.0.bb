SUMMARY = "wolfTPM Portable TPM 2.0 Library"
DESCRIPTION = "wolfTPM is a portable TPM 2.0 project, designed for embedded \
               use. It is highly portable, due to having been written in \
               native C, having a single IO callback for hardware interface, \
               no external dependencies, and its compact code with low \
               resource use."
